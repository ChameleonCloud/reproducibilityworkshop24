This repository hosts the artifact checklists developed during the [Community
Workshop on Practical Reproducibility in HPC](https://reproduciblehpc.org),
held in November 2024. These checklists are designed to guide researchers in
packaging and presenting their experiments to facilitate reproducibility in
high-performance computing (HPC) and systems computing environments.

The checklists are divided into two main categories:

1. **Experiment Packaging Checklist**: This checklist outlines the essential
   components and requirements for packaging experiments in a way that ensures
   all necessary resources, software, data, etc. are included for
   reproducibility along with considerations for longevity and maintenance.
2. **Experiment Style Checklist**: This checklist provides guidelines on how to
   structure and present experiments to enhance usability for reviewers. It
   includes recommendations on organization, validation, configuration,
   reproducibility conditions, and time/resource estimation.

## Downloading the Checklists

The checklists are available in both Markdown and PDF formats for easy access
and use.

- [Experiment Packaging Checklist (PDF)](experiment-packaging.pdf)
- [Experiment Style Checklist](experiment-style.md)
- [Experiment Style Checklist (PDF)](experiment-style.pdf)

## Contributing to the Checklists

The checklists for experiment packaging and style will continue to evolve as
reproducibility practices mature in the HPC community. To encourage feedback,
we are hosting these checklists here on our repository and invite community
contributions through GitHub pull requests:

To submit a pull request with suggested modifications:

1. Fork this repository. (Go to the main page of our [GitHub
   repo](https://github.com/ChameleonCloud/reproducibilityworkshop24) and click
   the "Fork" option at the top right corner.)
2. Create a new branch for your changes (optional).
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```
3. Make your modifications to the checklist files `experiment-style.md` or
   `experiment-packaging.md`. (You can edit files directly in GitHub or clone
   the repository locally and edit them using your preferred text editor.)
4. Submit a pull request to this repository with a clear description of your
   changes (including the rationale and any relevant context).

**Review Process**: Our committee will review all contributions within 4 weeks
of submission, evaluating them for practical utility and broad applicability
across HPC domains.

**Updates**: Approved contributions will be merged into the main branch, with
attribution to contributors.

This collaborative approach ensures the checklists remain current and
representative of best practices across the diverse HPC reproducibility
landscape.
