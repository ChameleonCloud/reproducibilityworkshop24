The checklists for experiment packaging and style will continue to evolve as reproducibility practices mature in the HPC community. To encourage feedback, we are hosting these checklists here on our repository and invite community contributions through the following process:

- Fork this repository and make edits to the draft. Push your changes to our main branch with a pull request.
- Our committee will review all contributions within 4 weeks of submission, evaluating them for practical utility and broad applicability across HPC domains.
- Approved contributions will be merged into the main branch, with attribution to contributors.

This collaborative approach ensures the checklists remain current and representative of best practices across the diverse HPC reproducibility landscape.
