The checklists for experiment packaging and style will continue to evolve as
reproducibility practices mature in the HPC community. To encourage feedback,
we are hosting these checklists here on our repository and invite community contributions
through the following process:


- **Contribution Mechanism**: Researchers can propose additions or modifications through GitHub pull requests or by opening issues on this repository.
- **Review Process**: Our committee will review all contributions within 4 weeks of submission, evaluating them for practical utility and broad applicability across HPC domains.
- **Updates**: Approved contributions will be merged into the main branch, with attribution to contributors.

This collaborative approach ensures the checklists remain current and representative of best practices across the diverse HPC reproducibility landscape.
