            <p>Reproducibility in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and systems
            research presents <em>unique challenges</em>. The requirements for
            <strong>specialized hardware, scale, and deep
            reconfigurability</strong> often make experiments extremely
            difficult to reproduce. The diverse nature of HPC research further
            complicates matters, with some experiments being relatively
            straightforward and low-cost to replicate, while others remain
            practically unfeasible. Despite these challenges, the
            <strong>potential benefits of reproducibility in HPC are
            immense</strong>. Examining experiments from various angles can
            yield significant insights, fostering collaboration by allowing
            researchers to <em>explore each other's results not just through
            reading, but through hands-on experimentation</em>.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <h2>Event Info</h2>
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, November 18, 2024<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Terminus 330, Atlanta, GA<br>

            <p>Our workshop, colocated in Atlanta with the <strong>premier <a
            href="https://sc24.supercomputing.org/">annual conference
            showcasing the latest innovations in supercomputing
            technology</a></strong>, aims to advance the concept of
            <em>practical reproducibility in HPC</em> - a practice where
            <strong>reproducing results becomes a mainstream method of
            scientific exploration</strong>. We will provide a forum for debate
            on the tools, services, and approaches that best support
            reproducibility in HPC and systems science, concluding with a
            <strong>comprehensive report that captures the community's
            collective knowledge and recommendations</strong> for advancing
            practical reproducibility in HPC and systems research.</p>
            <p>This workshop is supported by the <a
            href="https://chameleoncloud.org"><strong>Chameleon
            project</strong></a>, a cutting-edge cloud platform designed for
            computer science research. Chameleon has been instrumental as a
            platform for reproducibility in major conferences, including most
            <strong>recently serving as the default platform for the <a
            href="https://sc24.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/#infrastructure-for-artifact-evaluation">SC24
            Reproducibility Initiative</a></strong> as well as supporting
            others like ICPE, ACM CSS, EuroSys, FAST, OSDI/ATC, and more.</p>
            <p>We are excited to announce our featured keynotes from
            distinguished speakers including <strong>Torsten Hoefler, Professor
            of Computer Science at ETH Zurich, and Kate Keahey, Senior Computer
            Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory and PI of
            Chameleon</strong>. These talks will provide valuable insights into
            the <em>state-of-the-art in HPC reproducibility and future
            directions</em>.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Description:</strong> (One paragraph or less) <br> A brief but clear description of the Computer Science experiment you are packaging or reproducing: What research problem does it address? (What is the hypothesis? What is the challenge/trade-off? Why is it significant?) How does the experiment capture this research problem?</li>
                <li><strong>Reproducibility Approach: What is the description of the experiment you are either packaging or reproducing?</strong> (One paragraph or less) <br> What resources does it need and how many? How do those resources need to be configured? What is the experimental environments in which the experiment should run? How are they configured? What does the experiment body consist of? How long and in what manner is the experiment run? What types of data does it produce and how much? How is the data analyzed? What platforms or tools did you use in your experiment? </li>
                <li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> <br> Good and bad: What were the most important obstacles to either packaging for reproducibility or reproducing the experiment you encountered – and how did you overcome them? Were they on the infrastructure level (hardware availability), configuration level (how the hardware is configured, i.e., “creating an MPI cluster”), executing the experimental workflow, managing or analyzing data?  What strategies were effective? How did you decide (or what guidelines did you give to reviewers) as to when the experiment is reproduced?

                    <h4>Keynote: Reproducing Performance - The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h4>
                    <p class="abstract">Containers and Jupyter notebooks are useful tools for reproducing computational results of any packaged application. However, if the execution performance or efficiency is the science result, matters are more complex. It may not be sufficient to package codes in containers. In fact, containers may disturb the performance results and reproducibility. We outline a set of techniques to facilitate performance reproducibility in various settings. Some performance results may be linked to specific computer architectures or even specific system configurations that may not be accessible to other researchers or even the original team after a software update. We outline techniques to help researchers interpret results on the original system even if it is practically impossible to reproduce the original results. We discuss such techniques both in the context of pure performance but also in the context of the emerging field of data science and artificial intelligence that often allows for a performance-accuracy tradeoff. All-in-all, our work provides a set of guidelines to follow to support reproducible science of performance and benchmarking.</p>
